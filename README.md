-*"Listen to them, the children of the night. What Music they make!* ~ Bram Stoker ✒

Hello World! 👨‍💻 I'm Andreyōs, a thirty-something lunatic based in Chile, this one: 🇨🇱, not the spicy one 🌶

👨‍🎓 I'm interested in learning basically everything; my current fixation is **AI development and Data Sciences** 🤖

👨‍🏫 I can help you with algorithm creation, consumer experience (Some people say I'm a CS Ninja 🥷) and quite a lot of non sciency stuff. Wanna learn Chaos Magick? I'm your guy 🧙‍♂️; Never played Vampire: the masquerade before? Call me Le'stats 🧛‍♂️; Wanna re-hear that fact about *porcine sexual life*? Oink oink 🐷 I'm an expert in obscure trivia.

🎮 I'm more or a *vintage* kind of gamer. I love me some good old arcade 🕹 or some emulated old game 👾. I'm always ready to play Vampire, masquerade or requiem 🧛‍♂️; if you add a couple mummies, wizards and puppies, I can defend myself in World of Darkness. I used to play a lot or Lineage 2 and now I'm learning Wild Rift. 🐧 Fun fact: I was also stuck playing Linux games during my first installation... Oh Debian how I miss you 🤍

Are you still here? 🤷‍♂️ Well, HMU...

I'm also always up to playing something new, my Discord handle is **Andreyos#7028**. 

Twitter I shall never have, the blue bird 🐦 is dead to me. I can't handle adults fighting like children 🤡

~~If you made it this far, let hang out, you also need a life 🖖~~
